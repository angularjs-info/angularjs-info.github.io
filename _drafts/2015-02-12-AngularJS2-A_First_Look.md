Better? Worst? More simple? complex?
Lets look at a first application created with a first draft version of Angular2 + Firebase and its change detection.

Better? Worst? More simple? complex? Im not going to post any opinion. It is too early in the game.
NG-CONF is around the block and it IS going to be Angular2 centric.

## Todo MVC + 40 mins round of questions

With ng-conf right around the corner it's time to catch a glimpse of Angular2.
Angular Core Contributor David East will give an overview of what's new in Angular
and live code a Todo app with Angular2 and Firebase.  Get a taste of Angular2 before its alpha release!

is going to become obsolete and we want to be ready for that'

# Retro-compatibility

Angular1 in Angular2? other way around? 'So far, it is in our minds' (Igor's words)
