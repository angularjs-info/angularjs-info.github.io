Latest Protractor v1.0.0 is out. Congratulations!!!
Take a look at at the features and bug fixes from last version. Stay up to date!

# 1.0.0

No changes from rc6.

# 1.0.0-rc6

## Dependency Version Upgrades

- ([b6ab644](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/b6ab644dd8105d3f64e347342a0ae2ad2f0100fc))
  chore(jasminewd): update to version 1.0.4

  This version contains a fix for too many timeout messages.

## Bug Fixes

- ([0c4a70e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/0c4a70e0ffbbf4373dbd9f1ab29daabe9338d57b))
  fix(protractor) fix stack traces for WebElement errors

  When angular/protractor@3c0e727136ab3d397c1a9a2bb02692d0aeb9be40 refactored `element()` into the
  ElementFinder object, the function lost some of its error handling.  This removed references to
  frames inside tests (`it()` blocks), making it hard to tell where the error was actually
  occurring.

  This commit fixes these problems, showing full stack traces for WebElement errors.

# 1.0.0-rc5

## Features

- ([51a5e89](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/51a5e89f7dace45e61d8eab70e1ea6e9354d4de6))
  feat(config): allow setting the get page timeout globally from the config

  To change the timeout for how long a page is allowed to stall on `browser.get`, change
  `getPageTimeout: timeout_in_millis` in the configuration. As before, you may also change the
  timeout for one particular `get` call by using a second parameter:
  `browser.get(url, timeout_in_sec)`

## Bug Fixes

- ([985ff27](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/985ff27c9a94cca83af8db5bf7e570d826b23838))
  fix(configParser): load new functions from configs

  Closes #1043

## Breaking Changes

- ([51a5e89](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/51a5e89f7dace45e61d8eab70e1ea6e9354d4de6))
  feat(config): allow setting the get page timeout globally from the config

  This change contains a small breaking change for consistency. Previously, the second parameter to
  `get` changed the timeout in seconds. Now, the units are milliseconds. This is consistent with
  all the other timeouts, as well as base JavaScript functions like setTimeout.

   - before: `browser.get(url, 4)`
  - after: `browser.get(url, 4000)`

# 1.0.0-rc4

## Bug Fixes

- ([1198dde](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1198ddef9e353383819fca3a40bdaba0db22f96f))
  fix(navigation): use empty html data urls for page resets instead of about:blank

  Except on internet explorer, which does not allow data urls.

  Closes #1023.

# 1.0.0-rc2

## Dependency Version Updates

- ([e10e1a4](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/e10e1a4a8ae5013982f00d209e6fab1ff2b1d2a1))
  chore(minijasminenode): update minijasminenode dependency to v1.1.0

  This adds several options for the reporter, which can be included in protractor's
  `config.jasmineNodeOpts`
  ```js
  // If true, output nothing to the terminal. Overrides other printing options.
  silent: false,
  // If true, print timestamps for failures
  showTiming: true,
  // Print failures in real time.
  realtimeFailure: false
  ```

- ([be0bb00](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/be0bb00db6f51e381e31e80c6808a202270ecb20))
  chore(jasminewd): update jasminewd to v1.0.3

  This fixes extra logging when a timeout occurs.

## Features

- ([82c1d47](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/82c1d47462779688bb8c9ac74ba3a6ecfefb7775))

- ([62bcf7e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/62bcf7e1c84ed720bc17435c40e1f78c50ba194c))
  feat(webdriver-manager): minor proxy enhancements

  Added error handling for request - previously, any errors coming from the request module were
  silently swallowed.

  Fixed error handling to remove empty files when a download fails for some reason.

  Also evaluating both uppercase and lowercase proxy variables. Many tools use proxy variables in
  the form https_proxy, others use HTTPS_PROXY.
