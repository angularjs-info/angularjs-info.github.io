Latest Protractor v0.22.0 is out.
Define suites, browser.pause, browsers summary. Several bug fixes.


## Features

- ([8b088fd](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/8b088fd6bf83696fd2ad294d8818e20894332693))
  feat(locators): Added a By.cssContainingText locator.

  This new locator find elements by css selector and inner text in response to the lack of
  ':contains' selector.

  Example: By.cssContainingText('ul .pet', 'Dog') will find all ul children with class 'pet'
  containing the text 'Dog'.

  Closes #488, Closes #709

- ([54060b7](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/54060b7cef4eb2f4c184c360cef7c2eb25c0ff6a))
  feat(protractor): add the browser.setLocation method to perform in-page navigation

  Allow a faster way to navigate within the app. The current browser.get method forces the entire
  app to load every time you navigate to a new page. The proposed browser.setLocation method uses
  the same format as $location.url().

  Closes #368

- ([74761e8](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/74761e8b25395dd78e1c301ee23a7730fef36db9))
  feat(cli): use protractor.conf.js as a default config file if none is passed

  Closes #615

## Chores and updates

- ([b81cf5a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/b81cf5a949dee25c9070491edd1eb9e9feee556f))
  chore(webdriver): update WebDriverJS version to 2.41.0

- ([a96df4d](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/a96df4d60a1f2e09de865bf7ca9c5c780f945239))
  chore(minijasminenode): update to version 0.4.0.

  This allows the use of `because('message')` before expectations, to give additional information
  when a failure occurs.

  It also removes warnings for Node 0.11.* users about util.print being deprecated.

  Closes #377

- ([6f31b56](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/6f31b5619de4fdb9b1b6e9a29a62dac09b781c6b))
  chore(package): npm start now brings up the testapp

  Closes #712

## Bug Fixes

- ([1137d12](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1137d12b95435438d2b84448796f9fe32d2f87b2))
  fix(mocha): fix it.only so that it does not double-wrap

  Closes #469

- ([bde56a0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/bde56a0d92a79570f377490929dd1d05107f4e25))
  fix(cli): fix --exclude command line flag

  Accidentally got changed to 'excludes'. As discussed earlier, should be single to be consistent
  with Karma.

  Closes #637

- ([9e426df](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9e426dfd300a11f513c5d7202bbb632f4b1c41d8))
  fix(locators): using $().$$() should return an ElementArrayFinder

  Prior, $(foo).$$(bar) would return a promise which resolved to an array of WebElements. This is
  unexpected, since $(foo).$(bar) returns an ElementFinder, and
  element(by.css(foo)).element.all(by.css(bar)) returns an ElementArrayFinder. Fixed so things are
  more consistent.

  Closes #640

- ([b67810a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/b67810a08d19940cd144fea25f08af4478166231))
  fix(webdriver-manager): do not download files if HTTP response is not 200

  Closes #656

- ([28912f0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/28912f0a77b44cce19ef5367c92b023388f7ff10))
  fix(webdriver-manager): fix download paths
