  feat(framework.cucumber): Allow multiple tags on cucumber tests.

  Motivation: Support for multiple tags on the cucumber test execution, to be able to filter with
  more complex expressions the scenarios to run.

  How to use:
  ```
  cucumberOpts: {
     tags: '@dev'
  }
  ```

  or

  ```
  cucumberOpts: {
     tags: ['@dev', '~@ignore']
  }
  ```
