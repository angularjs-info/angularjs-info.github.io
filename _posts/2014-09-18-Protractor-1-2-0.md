Latest Protractor v1.2.0 is out. WOW!!
Take a look at at the features and bug fixes from last version. Stay up to date!

## Features

- ([830f511](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/830f51128d1ca6c8858c99617b2752172044a752)) 
  feat(protractor): allow file:// baseUrls

  Modified protractor to support testing node-webkit by using string concatenation vs url.resolve()
  when the baseUrl begins with file://

  Closes #1266.

- ([71b9c97](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/71b9c97432316a8409c7c83e28a3b1eba2d83f25)) 
  feat(cucumber): process the Cucumber 'coffee' param

## Bug Fixes

- ([ade9a92](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/ade9a9277558a564e15e46266a82aeb43261d958)) 
  fix(webdriver-manager): always use https for downloading webdriver binaries

  This fixes issues with unzipping - see #1259

- ([9a8f45a](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9a8f45af49633f1637c88960ba079d7d425ca72c)) 
  fix(locators): locators should use the root element provided in config

  Previously, locators used 'document' as the root for their search. After this change, they will
  use the root element provided in the config file -
  `config.rootElement`. This will make sure behavior is correct if there are multiple angular apps
  on one page, and also enables the getTestability path, because that requires a root element under
  an ng-app.

# 1.1.1
This is a minor release with no functional changes. It contains a couple
implementation switches that new versions of Angular will use.

# 1.1.0

## Features

- ([316961c](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/316961c6a5d7410d73a2784a9622b106008b0930)) 
  feat(runner/hosted): add support for promises for seleniumAddress and capabilities

  Change driverProviders/hosted to resolve promise values in configuration to allow async jobs in
  setup. Specifically, seleniumAddress, capabilities, and multiCapabilities may be promises.
  Primarily, this would be for a network call to acquire a selenium host or to start a proxy
  server.

- ([953faf7](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/953faf7ebee345f686bfedff61ebcb29c5170083)) 
  feat(runner): allow onPrepare functions to return a promise

  If onPrepare is a function which returns a promise (or a file which exports a promise), the test
  runner will now wait for that promise to be fulfilled before starting tests.

- ([6de2e32](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/6de2e32328fc30b43428973457db08f34b7c1839)) 
  feat(runner): Add support for async onCleanUp functions

  If the onCleanUp function returns a promise, the process will allow it to resolve before exiting.
  This is useful for performing async operations like writing to a file or calling an API at the
  end of a test run.

- ([cd575ee](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cd575ee3a4d8c0930db23ad66649bf0d665ce2d6)) 
  feat(sauce provider): allow for custom server addresses when running against SauceLabs.

  Use `config.sauceSeleniumAddress` to connect to a custom URL for Sauce Labs.

- ([1b16c26](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1b16c26ac143910d3f3e92a3db4ac6ab168a8544)) 
  feat(suites): allow more than one suite from the command line

  Allow a comma-separated list of suites be provided on the command line, like
  `--suite=suite1,suite2`

- ([25cf88c](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/25cf88c29449cef6b925d19ec9cd17671f1befc9))

  Other URLs use http, make chromedriver use this as well.
