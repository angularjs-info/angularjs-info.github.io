Until two months ago I was a heavy Emacs user. I'd use for taking notes, blogging, programming (even Java), you name it. But then I saw a Facebook's [F8 presentation][1] and there they mentioned Nuclide a new IDE built as a series of plug-ins on top of [Atom][2].

I saw a lot of resemblances between Atom and Emacs. They are both open source, extremely hackable, have tons of add-ons and are amazingly fast. For the first time my beloved editor had some serious competitor.

I decided to give it a try and discovered that it took me maybe two days to feel at home in Atom. I found myself very productive very soon, plus I discovered that a lot of the functionality I've written over the years for Emacs where there already. In short here are some of my reasons for making the switch:

  * Javascript is easier for me to hack than lisp
  * Modern UI. Granted Emacs was born as a console editor therefore lacks all the glitter
  * Fonts render better (this is very important if you spend a sizable amount of your day in the editor)
  * Lots, and I mean [lots of packages][3] and very active development
  * CUA mode works as expected in all conditions
  * Search for files and folders is awesome
  * Great support for all modern languages
  * Plenty more!

Don't get me wrong, I still miss some of the features that Emacs has but I think Atom is the future.

Let me know what you think in the comments section.
