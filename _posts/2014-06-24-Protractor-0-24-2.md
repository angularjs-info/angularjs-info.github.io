  fix(protractor): throw index-out-of-bounds

# 0.24.1

## Bug Fixes

- ([59af936](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/59af936e1ef6e21432f7876144554db145083d46))
  fix(locators): Missing information in warning/error messages

  Webdriver's built-in locators (such as `by.css()`) appeared as
  'undefined' in protractor's messages.

  For instance, if a locator matched multiple elements, protractor would print the following
  message: 'warning: more than one element found for locator undefined- you may need to be more
  specific'.

  fix(launcher): output error messages when child processes exit with error

  Version 0.24.0 introduced a bug where child processes would error without outputting the error
  message. Fix. See #902.

## Features

- ([7299155](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/729915554cfa440bda0eec8a1c4bf423f4089481))

  refactor(jasminewd): use jasminewd from its own node module

  The Jasmine Webdriver Adapter is now its own npm module. The code has been moved to
  http://www.github.com/angular/jasminewd.

  Remove the code from Protractor, and add a dependency on jasminewd@1.0.0.

- ([f23565d](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/f23565d5db4fbb102cfec8311ce9dfaee52e9113))

- ([876a3c0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/876a3c04c07a9f8d97e1edca3ec1f76e51e1a310))
  feat(runner): support running dart2js spec files

  This commit supports running Dart2JS output in NodeJS.  Officially, Dart2JS in supposed to only
  generate code for running in a real webbrowser.  With this patch, the dart2js code can also be
  executed in NodeJS.

  Ref:
  https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge/dart/sdk/lib/js/dart2js/js_dart2js.dart?spec=svn32943&r=32943#487

- ([8d46e21](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/8d46e210b91ed1521f6692a2cf35f60740c0ace6))
  feat(runner): support sourcemaps in spec files

  This feature allows folks who are generating their spec files from a different language to see
  stack traces that use the line numbers from their sources before translation.

  This commit introduces a dependency on the `source-map-support` library.

  For general information about sourcemaps, refer:

## Bug Fixes

- ([56daa54](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/56daa54e2e269064bd44bc05ed0bbf2c44657ca8))
  fix(clientsidescripts): convert non-Error exceptions to Errors

  If any functions called by clientSideScripts throws a an exception that doesn't inherit from
  `Error`, the stack trace is completely unhelpful and the message is just "unknown error."  This
  commit wraps such errors into
  `Error` instances so that we have meaningful stack traces and the correct exception message.
  (e.g. This is the common case when running dart2js code.  This commit gives us the Dart stack
  trace and exception message.)

  In addition, I've pushed the construction of the string to install into the browser into
  clientsidescripts.js.

  fix(element): fix WebElement.$ using the incorrect By object

  Closes #852

- ([0500b2c](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/0500b2c3b2698fe41bedf694b92aad884f3b0d0e))
  fix(navigation): ignore unknown JS errors when looking for the URL

  This should address #841

  Ignoring the error and trying again has worked for all of my test cases, and the error has never
  occurred more than once in a row.

- ([c8c85e0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/c8c85e0d94d7a7211b000650f01af714663611ad))
  fix(locators): fix by.repeater finding all rows for IE

  Previously, element.all(by.repeater('foo in foos')) would find non-element nodes for
  ng-repeat-start elements, which could cause IEDriver to fall over if the test tried to get text
  from those nodes.

## Breaking Changes

- ([3c0e727](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/3c0e727136ab3d397c1a9a2bb02692d0aeb9be40))
  refactor(protractor): reorganize internal structure of elementFinder/webelement

  - Allow chaining of actions (i.e. `element(By.x).clear().sendKeys('abc)`)
  - first(), last(), and get(index) are not executed immediately, allowing
      them to be placed in page objects
  - Rework the way that elementFinder and wrappedWebElement is represented
  - Breaking changes:
    - element.all is chained differently
        Before: element(By.x).element.all(By.y)
        Now:    element(By.x).all(By.y)

        However, using element.all without chaining did not change,
          i.e. `element.all(By.x)`

    - Changed the way for retrieving underlying webElements
        Before: element(By.x).find(), element(By.x).findElement(By.y),
                  and element(By.x).findElements(By.y)
        Now:    element(By.x).getWebElement(),
                  element(By.x).element(By.y).getWebElement(),
                  and element(By.x).element(By.y).getWebElements(),
                  respectively
    - browser.findElement returns a raw WebElement so $, $$, and
        evaluate will no longer be available

  feat(launcher): Add support for maxSession

  - add support for maxSession and capability-specific specs
  - cleaned up launcher (refactored out taskScheduler.js)
  - Breaking change:
    - changed the config to shard test files; also sharding is specific to
  capabilities now
      Before: config.splitTestsBetweenCapabilities
      Now: config.capabilities.shardTestFiles or config.multiCapabilities[index].shardTestFiles

- ([9e5d9e4](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9e5d9e4abb7d0928e6092a711fda527554994be7))
  feat(locators): remove deprecated locator APIs

  This is a **breaking change**. The following deprecated Locator APIs have been removed.

  - `by.input`
  - `by.select`
  - `by.selectedOption`
  - `by.textarea`

  `input`, `select`, and `textarea` can be replaced by `by.model`.

  `element(by.selectedOption('foo'))` can be replaced by
  `element(by.model('foo')).$('option:checked')`
