Latest AngularJS version is out. 1.2.10. AngularJS 1.2.10 augmented-serendipity has been released.
See what has changed.

From Matias's words:

"This is a fairly small release which contains a few small fixes to inputs, parsing & routing as well as a large amount of documentation-related fixes.
It also contains a new feature for ngAnimate which provides support to allow for other directives to detect when an animation has ended using the close callback (finally!).
