## Bug Fixes

- ([30023f2](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/30023f2689171bc4f51a173d9cfd62a18fe276c5)) 
  fix(runner): setTestPreparer does not work

  setTestPreparer would always set the testPrepare to config.onprepare during
  `runner.run()`. This is breaking for code that relies on setTestPreparer directly.

- ([47f12ba](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/47f12ba31754346062a1e1d20380346a1c7a0659)) 
  fix(clientsidescripts): make findByCssContainingText tolerate elements with no
  textContent/innerText

- ([6a9b87c](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/6a9b87cac9b85cde6ae464eafe4abbba27e4fe4f)) 
  fix(elementexplorer): eval always treat result as promise

- ([289dbb9](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/289dbb91a0676add40c12bb85d134904c57dcefd)) 
  fix(util): properly handle exceptions from onPrepare and onExit

- ([a132fac](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/a132fac0afed5dc5fe8e2663e5aa1c1a90586920)) 
  fix(jasmine): fix errors when iit was used

  Errors were due to Jasmine not calling reportSpecStarting when iit was used, but calling
  reportSpecResults.

  Closes #1602

## Breaking Changes

- ([0bbfd2b](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/0bbfd2b6d38392938781d846ad37b5a0fd964004)) 
  feat(protractor/runner): allow multiple browser in test

  `protractor.getInstance()` had been unused (replaced by global `browser` in v0.12.0)
  and is now removed.

# 1.4.0

## Features

- ([adef9b2](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/adef9b208fcba2a9d60347bda38a3fe3fac6bf50)) 
  feat(runner): add a new method of getting browser drivers - directConnect

  directConnect as an option on the configuration will replace chromeOnly. Now, WebDriverJS allows
  Firefox to be used directly as well, so directConnect will work for Chrome and Firefox, and throw
  an error if another browser is used.

  This change deprecates but does not remove the chromeOnly option.

- ([0626963](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/06269636f52f9b3a9c73beb6191ae89a7a376cfb)) 
  feat(config): Option to exclude test for specific capability

  Add the option to exclude spec files for a specific capability. This way you can ignore spec
  files for one capability only. For example if the test is known to fail in the capability.

  Closes #1230

- ([710cad7](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/710cad7c5a2d838a0c4184defa1b7d4240f577f6)) 
  feat(runner/frameworks): Change interface contract of the protractor runner instance so that it
  returns a promise instead of calling a callback function

- ([50f44f4](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/50f44f430851cbd76dbb3a41d6071198f6f479a4)) 
  feat(protractor): add clone methods for ElementFinder and ElementArrayFinder

- ([eedf50b](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/eedf50b48ca55f18e8555ce5aa64ad92b03887c8)) 
  feat(launcher): add beforeLaunch and afterLaunch

- ([8dd60b7](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/8dd60b73a3013bd29213c8d281819da6e545c7ff)) 
  feat(protractor): wrap negative indices for ElementArrayFinder.get(i)

  Closes #1213

- ([be236e7](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/be236e7f44c5306df36b62bb21bb3ba940c86944)) 
  feat(debugging): use custom messages when executing scripts to improve stack traces

  Now, instead of asynchronous events during executeScript all being described as
  `WebDriver.executeScript`, they have their own custom messages. The schedule shown when debugging
  will be more informative.

## Dependency Version Upgrades

- ([889a5a7](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/889a5a70c1f980d09a615cf1e8ceaea33272ba8e)) 
  feat(webdriver): version bumps for webdriver, chromedriver, webdriverJS

  Upgrade to WebDriver 2.44.0 and ChromeDriver 2.12.

## Bug Fixes

- ([2fbaf52](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/2fbaf52fd59f03929e173ebf760a97de34bf91d4)) 
  fix(element): use the root element only to find the testability API, not scope searches

  In 9a8f45a a change was introduced which made Protractor's custom locators (by.binding, by.model,
  etc) use config.rootElement as the root for all their searches. This meant that
  config.rootElement was used both to specify how to get hold of Angular's injector as well as
  where to begin searching for elements. This does not work for all cases, for example if a dialog 
  should be searched for elements but is a sibling, not a child, of ng-app.

  This reverts that change, and uses document as the parent for all searches. This is consistent
  with the behavior of the native locators by.id, by.css, and friends, which do not scope their
  search based on config.rootElement.

- ([9db5327](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9db5327e4ada7eb3caa271b394bcda0ba5e8fd62)) 
  fix(ElementFinder): ElementFinder should allow null as success handler. Passes the value to the
  next in the chain.

- ([0858280](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/0858280db156f924ef126c3aaeae6973b8d44067)) 
  fix(locators): by.cssContainingText now operates on pre-transformed text

  Previously, the implementation depended on the browser. Now, it will always operate on the text
  before text-transform is applied. Closes #1217

- ([1a4eea4](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/1a4eea4eb89362822dc86be6904c1ddfba95661e)) 
  fix(elementexplorer): elementexplorer hangs when returning ElementFinder

- ([f4e6b40](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/f4e6b40c597dc1c59dc7eccfe236abcc336a46a9)) 
  fix(runner): webdriver could get into lock when there is async promise

- ([cf284b9](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cf284b994fb6766c8ab34d0af9b4ccf8fd866bd1)) 
  fix(clientsidescripts): by.exactBinding not working because of regex typo

  Closes #1441

- ([9cc0f63](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/9cc0f6398146ed9bfc757c1efc05d1806bab1e16)) 
  fix(runner): gracefully shutdown browsers after test

- ([86ead2c](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/86ead2c5a20d474e59c3b9796b5438dc2090a6ed)) 
  fix(webdriver-manager): Avoid incompatibility between request with callback and pipe.

- ([7283fdf](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/7283fdfa1e4c69bcab6af8f28f8f1b77634a50fd)) 
  fix(launcher): exit code is always 100 for sharded and 1 for nonsharded tests

# 1.3.1

## Bug Fixes

- ([714e4e2](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/714e4e28ab90fb5dfeca4375a68469ef609e2722)) 
  fix(locators): fix regression passing root element to locator scripts

  Closes #1378

# 1.3.0

## Features

- ([4f1fe68](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/4f1fe68882dedba662752e722b9e7b76bfed19b6)) 
  feat(runner): Allow onCleanup to accept a file

- ([548f0c0](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/548f0c09748502cb6ae87e602db09e6df78df348)) 
  feat(webdriver): bump WebDriver to version 2.43

- ([466b383](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/466b3831569dc28c5fc2be31fbdf96574e57c3f0)) 
  feat(protractor): allow advanced features for ElementArrayFinder

  changed ElementFinder as a subset of an ElementArrayFinder.

  This enables actions on ElementArrayFinders, such as:
  `element.all(by.css('.foo')).click()`

  The function `filter` now returns an ElementArrayFinder, so you may also do:
  `element.all(by.css('.foo')).filter(filterFn).click()`

  or

  `element.all(by.css('.foo')).filter(filterFn).last().click()`

- ([7bd2dde](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/7bd2dde0a6fca8c8481ad68d0683b4f411d611b9)) 
  chore(angular): upgrade angular to version 1.3.

  This change updates Protractor's test application from 1.2.9 to 1.3.0-r0.

  There is a significant behind-the-scenes change in the implementation of locating elements and
  waiting for the page to be stable. If you are updating your application to Angular 1.3, you may
  run into some changes you will need to make in your tests:

   - `by.binding` no longer allows using the surrounding `{{}}`. Previously, these
     were optional.

   - Prefixes `ng_` and `x-ng-` are no longer allowed for models. Use `ng-model`.

   - `by.repeater` cannot find elements by row and column which are not children
    of the row.

- ([ee82f9e](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/ee82f9e3d0656b3c88f041f0115743352bc08941)) 
  feat(webdriver-manager): ignore ssl checks with --ignore_ssl option

  Allow ability to ignore SSL checks when downloading webdriver binaries. Usage: `webdriver-manager
  update --ignore_ssl`

## Bug Fixes

- ([838f5a2](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/838f5a2b248b1539b7ece13a8ccb921eda08ee45)) 
  fix(element): isPresent should not throw on chained finders

  Now, `$('nonexistant').$('foo').isPresent()` will return false instead of throwing an error. This
  change also adds tests that ensure that catching errors from promises works as expected.

## Breaking Changes

- ([f7c3c37](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/f7c3c370a239218f6143a4992b1fc4763f4cdd3d)) 
  feat(webdriver): update to WebDriverJS 2.43.5

  Breaking Changes WebDriverJS has introduced changes in the way that Promises are handled in
  version 2.43. See
  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver/CHANGES.md
  - `webdriver.WebElement` has now been split into `webdriver.WebElementPromise`
    and `webdriver.WebElement` so that it does not resolve to itself. This change
    should be largely transparent to users.
  - `WebElement.toWireValue` has been removed.
