Built to foster collaboration and iteration, InVision helps our clients design, review and user-test a product before writing a single line of code, with tools for design prototyping, feedback, task management and version control.

We’re well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including FirstMark Capital and Tiger Global Management.

We're looking for a Sr. JavaScript and AngularJS developer who can jump into an existing AngularJS application (with a lot of code) and help our team really rock. The ideal candidate can take a .PSD file and turn it into an awesome HTML5/CSS/AngularJS user experience that sings without breaking a sweat.
