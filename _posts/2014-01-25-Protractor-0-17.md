Latest Protractor version is out. 0.17.0 See what has changed in this rapidly growing automation testing framework.

## 0.17.0
_Note: Major version 0 releases are for initial development, and backwards incompatible changes may be introduced at any time._

### Features

- ([cc4f7b5](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/cc4f7b55e1fe46fcef1b8c3ca39d702a32ee6d82)), ([8348803](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/834880368115ecade154b3a090e06159667c0c2d))
  feat(element): allow chaining of element finders with element().element()...

  Chaining calls to element will now build a scoped element finder. No webdriver functions will be
  called until a method (such as getText) is called on the final element. Example:

      var elem = element(by.id('outer')).element(by.css('inner'));
     browser.get('myPage');
     elem.click();

  Closes #340.
