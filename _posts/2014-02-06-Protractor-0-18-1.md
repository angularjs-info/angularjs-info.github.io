Latest Protractor version is out. 0.18.1. Julie Ralph provides guidelines for contributors.
See what has changed in this rapidly growing automation testing framework.

Besides the list of changes, if you are a contributor or you think you may become one, there was an interesting discussion about the feature "byButtonText".
[link](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/452) where we briefly discussed protractor's scope. Lucky for us,
Julie Ralph provided some useful guidelines:

     WebDriverJS is a pretty direct implementation of the WebDriver standards. Those are going through the W3C becoming standards now, so they're unlikely to change. So, WebDriverJS won't have a buttonText anytime soon.

     I think it's a useful locator, so the question is then whether to have it in Protractor or in some other helper library. Since this was a small and useful change I accepted it, but I do worry about code bloat if other things start getting added. For example, I'd like to add helpers to deal with select elements, but I think that's complicated enough (and of wide use) that it deserves its own helper repository that Protractor will depend on (and adapt to its own syntax).

     Hope that was vaguely helpful...


This is not the first time I was lucky and Julie spent some time answering some of my annoying questions / guidelines inquires.

  The 300 ms wait caused problems when testing IE on Sauce Labs. It seems way too short.
