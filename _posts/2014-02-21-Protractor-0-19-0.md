Latest Protractor version is out. 0.19.0. Major updates for the runner. Multiple drivers can be kicked off at once.
See what has changed in this rapidly growing automation testing framework.


Testing against multiple browsers
---------------------------------

If you would like to test against multiple browsers at once, use the multiCapabilities configuration option.

```javascript
multiCapabilities: [{
  'browserName': 'firefox'
}, {
  'browserName': 'chrome'
}]
```

Protractor will run tests in parallel against each set of capabilities. Please note that if multiCapabilities is defined, the runner will ignore the `capabilities` configuration.

## Breaking Changes
- ([05eb42b](https://github.com/angular/protractor/commit/05eb42bb482c7cb36b48af1a86210afc442aa112))
  refactor(locators): moves scope in locators to last argument

  scope defaults to document, and is an optional argument so now be moved to the end. Came up from
  debugging and trying to use window.clientSideScripts.findInputs('username'); which failed.
  Refactored to match original intent.

  BREAKING CHANGE: anything relying on clientsidescripts should no longer pass
     element scope as first argument.

      Before:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs(document, 'username');

      After:

      window.clientSideScripts.findInputs(document, 'username');

    Also, any custom locators using addLocator will now break since the
    arguments order has chnaged. To migrate the code follow the example below:

      Before:

      var findMenuItem = function() {
        var domScope = arguments[0];
        var myArg = arguments[1];
        // balh blah blah
      };
      by.addLocator('menuItem', findMenuItem);

      After:

      var findMenuItem = function() {
        var myArg = arguments[0];
        var domScope = arguments[1];
        // balh blah blah
      };
      by.addLocator('menuItem', findMenuItem);

  Closes #497
