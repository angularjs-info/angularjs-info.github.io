  ([e7338d3f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/31c450bcee53d0a3827b7e0a611e9013b2496506),
   [#2848](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/2848), [#1459](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1459), [#3647](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/3647), [#3241](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/3241))

  ([a9fcb0d0](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/a9fcb0d0fc6456f80501b8820d02b04d7c15b6d6),
   [#6247](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/6247), [#6231](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/6231))

  ([2b730271](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/2b7302713674506fdbcdc396c38f18dcb90dee8c),
   [#6058](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/6058), [#5433](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5433))


## Features

- **filterFilter:** support deeply nested predicate objects
  ([b4eed8ad](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b4eed8ad94ce9719540462c1ee969dfd3c6b2355),
   [#6215](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/6215))


## Breaking Changes

- **$animate:**
  - due to [4f84f6b3](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/4f84f6b3e4210ae1eb14728a46d43dd961700a0c),
    ngClass and {{ class }} will now call the `setClass`
    animation callback instead of addClass / removeClass when both a
    addClass/removeClass operation is being executed on the element during the animation.

    Please include the setClass animation callback as well as addClass and removeClass within
    your JS animations to work with ngClass and {{ class }} directives.


  - due to [cf5e463a](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/cf5e463abd2c23f62e9c2e6361e6c53048c8910e),
    Both the `$animate:before` and `$animate:after` DOM events must be now
    registered prior to the $animate operation taking place. The `$animate:close` event
    can be registered anytime afterwards.

    DOM callbacks used to fired for each and every animation operation that occurs within the
    $animate service provided in the ngAnimate module. This may end up slowing down an
    application if 100s of elements are being inserted into the page. Therefore after this
    change callbacks are only fired if registered on the element being animated.
